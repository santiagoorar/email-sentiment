First of all, it is important to remark that this dataset does not contain mails of clients but just financial news. This implies a big limitation of the data for the training of the model: The results of the training will not have the power of generalization for the task. However, this dataset will still be used as it has labels to train the model and is relatively small in order to run it in aws (free version).
